## About HTML and CSS

### HTML
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language 
for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics


### Starting Point
Before the coding begins, a few things must be done. First, a program used to create the code must be downloaded and install. 
Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, and Brackets are three programs that are easily used. This guide will be using Visual Studio Code, as it is very beginner friendly. 
Next, a folder and files must be created. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new folder, naming it something simple like “portfolio”. 
Then create an HTML file named “index.html” and a CSS file titled “style.css.” 
We also need a folder named “Images” and we should also put a few images in the folder. After this is done, the coding can begin.
